            <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
            <p>The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. Named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it in his private correspondence, this cipher works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the shift is 3, the word "HELLO" becomes "KHOOR".</p>

        <section id="rsa">
            <h2>RSA Encryption</h2>
            <p>RSA is a widely used encryption method in modern computing, named after its inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman. Unlike the Caesar Cipher, which is a form of symmetric encryption, RSA is an asymmetric encryption technique, meaning it uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.</p>
            <p>The security of RSA encryption is based on the mathematical challenge of factoring large prime numbers. RSA is extensively used for secure data transmission, including in HTTPS and digital signatures.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you encrypt the message "HELLO" using someone's public key, only their private key can decrypt it.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Comparison Section -->
        <section id="comparison">
            <h2>Comparison between Caesar Cipher and RSA</h2>
            <p>While both the Caesar Cipher and RSA encryption are used for securing messages, they differ significantly in complexity, security, and application.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Caesar Cipher is simple and easy to implement, whereas RSA involves complex mathematical operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Caesar Cipher is easily breakable, especially with modern computing power. RSA, on the other hand, offers a much higher level of security.</li>
                <li><strong>Application:</strong> Caesar Cipher is mostly used for educational purposes and simple obfuscation. RSA is used in a wide range of secure communication systems, including internet protocols and secure emails.</li>
